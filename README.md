# Numerical-PDEs
The goal of this project is to develop a rigorous and in-depth introduction to numerical methods for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). In contrast to many textbooks, this project includes live code interlaced with the text that can executed and manipulated while reading. This text aims to be fully rigorous, providing proofs or references wherever possible. A major goal is for the reader to learn how to develop their own schemes and prove performance and stability guarantees that allow the schemes to be used with confidence. 

This is a work in progress. At this stage, there may be many typos.
