    "All that the linear transport equation does is take the initial conditions and shift them over time, with a speed of $a$. For this reason, we can say that information travels with a finite speed, namely $a$. In the heat equation, we saw that a scheme which did not take into account global information did very poorly. In contrast, we expect that a scheme which takes into account only local information can be just fine, because all the information needed to propagate the solution forward is local."

We will find out that many schemes do not perform nearly as well as we would have hoped, especially if the initial conditions are not particularly nice."
